# JavaDB
A simple, fully functional MariaDBhandler written by me in Java using MVC. 

It's got an easy to use GUI with CRUD options for your database.

Add the .jar file to your project as a environment variable ([how-to](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/installing-mariadb-connectorj/)) and run the main method to start the program :shipit:.
